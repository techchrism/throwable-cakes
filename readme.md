# Throwable Cakes

Spigot plugin enabling cakes to be thrown and customized.

## Features

### Throwable Cakes
Cakes can be thrown by right-clicking. They can also be thrown from a dispenser.
Upon colliding with an entity, the entity will be knocked back (proportional to mass) and slowed.
The cake will stick to the entity and slide down slowly.

To place a cake normally, sneak and place the cake on the ground.

Cakes can be crafted with certain items for upgrades:

#### Custom Color
When crafted with any dye, the cake particles will be colored to match.

#### Trail
When crafted with sugar, the flying cake will leave a particle trail.

#### Sticky
When crafted with a honey bottle, the cake will remain stuck to the hit entity until the entity is clicked with a water bottle.

#### Slow
When crafted with a feather, the cake travels in slow motion.

#### Combinations
All cake upgrades can be combined with each other.

### Time Crystal
Crafted with a cake and an amethyst shard.
Right-clicking with the crystal in hand will freeze/unfreeze all thrown cakes.
It can also be used in a dispenser for redstone interactivity.
